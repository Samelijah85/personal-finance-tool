## Project Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend and backend.

- **Backend**: 
  - Built using FastAPI with a RESTful API.
  - MongoDB serves as the primary data storage system.
  - JWT-based authentication secures access to the application.
  
- **Frontend**: 
  - Built with Vue.js, utilizing Vuetify for a modern UI.
  - Axios handles HTTP requests to communicate with the backend API.
  - Vue Router provides dynamic navigation between components.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- **Python 3.8+** for backend
- **Node.js 16+** for frontend
- **MongoDB** installed or accessible remotely

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Samelijah85/personal-finance-tool.git
   cd personal-finance-tool/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db-name
   ```

5. Run the FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

### Frontend Setup (Vue.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to view the app.

3. **Managing Transactions**:
   - Add, edit, or delete transactions using the transaction management UI.
   
4. **Setting Budgets**:
   - Create and manage budgets, and associate them with your transactions.
   
5. **Viewing Summary Reports**:
